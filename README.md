# morpheus-latin-stemlibs
This is a frozen version of the Morpheus Latin Stemlibs used by the Perseids Morphology service.  
Building the current source from https://github.com/PerseusDL/morpheus results in some errors with irregular verbs.
This is the last known set of fully functional built stems.
